* Instructions to run the script

1. Is necessary to install Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment), the script uses the v16.17.0 version.
2. Download the entire directory (opanga).
4. Open a terminal CLI and move to opanga directory
3. From /opanga run the command `npm install` to get all the dependencies.
4. To execute the script, move to src directory (opanga/src) and type `node index.js`, 
  by default the file tests that the script will open is test2.txt (opanga/testsFiles/test2.txt)
  if you want to open another tests file instead of default, you have to specify in the command to launch it as an argument, for example `node index.js test1.txt` 
5. To execute tests, type `npm run test`
